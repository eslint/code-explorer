# eslint-code-explorer

This repository contains a tool designed to help developers explore and understand the scope and structure of their JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It leverages ESLint's scope analysis capabilities to provide a detailed view of variables, references, and scopes within the code.

Key features of this repository include:

-   Visualization of scopes, variables, and references using an interactive UI.
-   Components such as `ScopeItem` and `TreeEntry` to render detailed information about each scope and its contents.
-   Integration with ESLint's scope analysis to accurately represent the code structure.
-   A user-friendly interface with expandable and collapsible sections for better navigation.

This tool is particularly useful for developers looking to gain insights into their code's structure, identify potential issues, and improve code quality through better understanding of scope and variable usage.
